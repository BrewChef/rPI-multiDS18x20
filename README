The new version works with multiple sensors & doesn't forget how they are ordered on the bus. There was a "feature" in the old version of the code where upon reset, the sensors might get detected in a different order and data written to the wrong slots in the RRDtool database.

There is an example sensors.conf & database in the /example directory. This is for a 6 sensor system. The graph plotting script can be used as a base to create your own, if you come up eith a good way to programatically generate the graph plotting script, please share it with me!

==Very short HOWTO==

Install the 1-wire libraries on your rPI
Wire up your sensors according to the diagram here - just connect multiple sensors in parallel (http://webshed.org/wiki/File:Fritzing_rPI_DS1820.png)

run detect.pl to find sesnors in the 1-wire bus
edit sensors.conf to give them nice names (if you wish) and any offset / calibration values you need
(format is NAME , OFFSET , 1-WIRE ID)

run makedb.pl to create the RRDTOOL database

call gettemp.pl from a cron job or some otherway to periodically read the sensors and update the database

use the examples/graph.sh file as a base for your own graphing needs.
