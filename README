The new version works with multiple sensors & doesn't forget how they are ordered on the bus. There was a "feature" in the old version of the code where upon reset, the sensors might get detected in a different order and data written to the wrong slots in the RRDtool database.

There is an example sensors.conf & database in the /example directory. This is for a 6 sensor system. The graph plotting script can be used as an base to create your own, if you come up eith a good way to programatically generate the graph plotting script, please share it with me!
