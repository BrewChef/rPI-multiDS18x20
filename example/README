This is a simple example.

There are 6 sensors on the bus, detected with "./detect.pl" the sensors.conf file has been edited 
to give them nice names, named after the planets - just to show you can. I've also set different offsets / cal
values for each of them, else all 6 will show the same temp (they are next to each other on the breadboard).

A cron job calls "gettemp.pl" every 300s and "graph.sh" every 360s. You'll need to edit "graph.sh" or use it as
a base for your own graphing software. You should be able to make changed to "graph.sh" here and run it against 
the example database to check it works.

Have fun.
